## Description
This is an application created for ascertaining skills and capabilities for an internship position at The Bee Company üêù. 
### This application has the following endpoints:
- POST /register -> Endpoint to register new user. (Public)
- POST /login -> Endpoint to log in. (Public)
- POST /logout -> Endpoint to log out. (Secured)
- POST /tasks -> Create a new task. (Secured)
- PUT /tasks/{id} -> Update an existing record. (Secured)
- GET /tasks/{id} -> Get more info about a task. (Secured)
- GET /tasks?status={status} -> Get tasks, that were filtered by status. (Secured)


All data is stored in H2 database and **IS LOST** after the aplication is shutdown.

## Demonstartion

This section will demonstarte the basic functionality. Everything will be done on a local machine via terminal.

### 1) Start the application.

Once the application starts, we can start issuing the commands.

### 2) Register

Before we can create record we have to register. We can do this by POSTing to `/register` endpoint. You can replace username and password with your preferd ones.

```curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "user", "password": "user"}'```

If everything goes well, we should see response with code 201 Created.

### 3) Log in

In order for us to issue requests to protected endpoints, we need to have a valid authorization token. To get it, we simply log in by POSTing out registered user details to `/login` endpoint.

```curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "user", "password": "user"}'```

If all is done correctly, we should get response with code 200 OK and our token for future use. One account can have only 1 token at one time, newly created tokens will overwrite old ones.

### 4) Create task

Now that we have our token, we can access all secured endpoints by adding it to the `Authorization` header. Let's create a new simple task.

```curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d '{"status": "ACTIVE","name": "Test Task","description": "This is a test task."}'```

If the operation succseeds, we should get code 201 Created. If the gotten code is 401 or 403, then `Authorization` header is likely missing, if the code is 400, then the request has a mistake in it.

### 5) Get created task

To check if our task was actually created and saved, we can try to get it. In this case we know the `ID` of our task, so we can reach it directly via `GET /tasks/{id}` endpoint.

```curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks/1 -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"```

We can see our task is indeed created.

### 6) Update already created task

If we made a mistake or just want to change some field of our tasks, we can use `PUT /tasks/{id}` endpoint. If task was created by us, we can edit it.

```curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:8080/tasks/2 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token> -d '{"status": "ACTIVE","name": "Updated Test Task","description": "This is an updated test task description."}'```

If we get code 200 OK our update went through.

To check if our update record is indeed live, we can use previous `GET` endpoint.

```curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"```

We indeed get our updated record.

### 7) Get tasks by status

If we don't know task's `ID` or even want to filter by `status` of our tasks, we can use `GET /tasks?=status{status}` endpoint. To demnostarte it better, let's add a few more tasks.

```curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d '{"status": "INACTIVE","name": "Test Task 2","description": "This is a test task 2."}'```


```curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -d '{"status": "ACTIVE","name": "Test Task 3","description": "This is a test task 3."}'```

Here we added 2 more tasks. Main difference is that task 2 has `INACTIVE` status and task 3 has `ACTIVE`. When we filter by `ACTIVE` status, our task 2 should NOT be present.

```curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks?status=ACTIVE -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"```

Indeed we get only task 1 and 3.

### 8) Log out

Once our work is done we can POST a request to our `/logout` endpoint. This will invalidate our token and to get a new one we would have to log in again. It's important to know, that tokens expire after 10 hours.

```curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8080/logout -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"```

If we get code 200 OK, that means our token is invalidated.

To check if our token is indeed invalidated, we can try to access any secured endpoint using it. For example, let's check task with `ID` 1.
```curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/tasks/1 -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"```

We indeed cannot reach our task with `ID` 1.
